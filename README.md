My keyboard layout, modifiers only, implemented in Auto-Hotkey using the Dual
framework.

Design philosophy
-----------------

1. Modifiers should be symmetrical

    All modifier keys, that is key held in conjunction with a regular key, should
    be symmetrical.  That way one hand can press the modifier key and one hand can
    press the regular key.

2. Maximize use of keys near home position

    Caps-lock is very easy to press, but not very useful.  Control is very hard to
    press, but very useful.

    These keys should be dual use keys, combining a "held down" and a "tapped"
    function.

    Modifiers:
    - ctrl
    - alt
    - shift

    Tapped special keys:
    - escape
    - backspace

3. Maximize portability

    Between laptops, keyboards, and co-workers, it is best to keep things as
    consistent as possible.
